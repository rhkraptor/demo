# demo
Wanted to check out the Git and GitHub ans specially the concept of versioning, colabing and co-working!

## Subheader
It is going well!!!!!

### Intro to commands
>. "git clone" brings a repository that is hosted somewhere else i.e. Github into a folder on your local machine.
 "add" Track your files and changes in Git.
 "commit" saves your files in Git.
 "push" upload Git commits to a remote repo, like GitHub.
 "pull" ´download changes from remote repo to your local machine, the opposite of push.
 "ls -la" is the equalent of "la" in windows., which means list all.
 "git add ." will add new changes and even new folders will be added to git. For saving changes individually we can use command "git add filename".
>. "reset" is used to clear all code and commands in the terminal.


### How to push to GitHub
>. First of all check status by using command: ""git status"", the changes will be shown in red higlighted text.
 Then to save locally the changes first use command: ""git  add ."", and check the git status again , now the modifications will bw shown in green highlighted text.
 And now the changes are ready to be commited, which we will do by using command: "" git commit -m "a" -m "a" "", "a" are for your messages, that what and why?.
 Now use command:  ""git push origin main"".
 If this don't works, use first: ""git pull"".
 Then use: ""git log"", to resolve merging issues.
>. Then again use: ""git push -u origin main -f"".
